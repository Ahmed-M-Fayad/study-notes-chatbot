As '\n           'you can see, the two are similar in concept, but each has a different number of layers '\n           'with different names. 3 The TCP/IP Protocol Suite The DoD and OSI models are alike in '\n           'design and concept and have similar functions in similar layers. 4 Process/Application '\n           'Layer This section describes different applications and services typically used in IP '\n           'networks. The following protocols and applications are discussed: –Telnet –FTP –TFTP '\n           '–NFS –SMTP –LPD –X Window –SNMP –DNS –DHCP/ BootP 5 Host to Host Layer The main '\n           'purpose of the Host -to-Host layer is to shield the upper -layer applications from the '\n           'complexities of the network. This layer says to the upper layer, “Just give me your '\n           'data stream, with any instructions, and I’ll begin the process of getting your '\n           'information ready to send.” The following sections describe the two protocols at this '\n           'layer: – Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) – User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 6 TCP The '\n           'figure shows the different fields within the TCP header. 7 UDP This figure clearly '\n           'illustrates UDP’s markedly low overhead as compared to TCP’s hungry usage . 8 Key '\n           'concepts of Host to Host Protocols TCP UDP Sequenced Unsequenced Reliable Unreliable '\n           'Connection -oriented Connectionless Virtual circuit Low overhead Acknowledgments No '\n           'acknowledgment Windowing flow control No windowing or flow control 9 Port Numbers Port '\n           'number examples for TCP and UDP 10 Key Protocols and Port Numbers 11TCP UDP Telnet 23 '\n           'SNMP 161 SMTP 25 TFTP 69 HTTP 80 DNS 53 FTP 21 DNS 53 HTTPS 443 Internet Layer 12IP '\n           'Header Internet Layer 13Protocol Field in IP Header Internet Layer 14Protocol Field in '\n           'IP Header Protocol Protocol Number ICMP 1 IP in IP (tunneling) 4 IGRP 9 EIGRP 88 OSPF '\n           '89 IPv6',\n  'distance': 1.0807307958602905,\n  'metadata': { 'chunk_id': 0,\n                'filename': 'Chapter 2_ TCP_IP.pdf',\n                'source': '/kaggle/input/study-notes/Lectures/Computer Networks/Chapter 2_ '\n                          'TCP_IP.pdf',\n                'subject': 'Computer Networks'}}\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":179},{"cell_type":"code","source":"context = \"\\n\\n\".join([r['chunk'] for r in top_chunks])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-03T03:17:01.369897Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-03T03:17:01.370107Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-03T03:17:01.373771Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-03T03:17:01.370091Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-03T03:17:01.373084Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":180},{"cell_type":"code","source":"prompt = f\"\"\"\nRead the context below and answer the question clearly and concisely.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Focus only on key and accurate information.\n- Combine repeated ideas into one.\n- Organize the answer in short paragraphs or bullet points if appropriate.\n- Skip irrelevant text or citations.\n- Keep a neutral and professional tone.\n\nContext:\n{context}\n\nQuestion:\n{question}\n\nAnswer:\n\"\"\"\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-03T03:17:03.190294Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-03T03:17:03.191079Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-03T03:17:03.194571Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-03T03:17:03.191047Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-03T03:17:03.193829Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":181},{"cell_type":"code","source":"answer = generate_text_t5(prompt)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-03T03:17:42.685064Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-03T03:17:42.685324Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-03T03:17:56.117511Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-03T03:17:42.685305Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-03T03:17:56.116730Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['early_stopping'].
